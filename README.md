Challenge: Digital Fascinator
# Proposal
I intend to create a terrain landscape generator using a hydraulic erosion algorithm from the internet. This algorithm will be applied to a height map-based terrain generator.
The minimum viable product I wish to create is single displayed area which the user can modify using in fascinator UI. The generation should not freeze the fascinator but does not need to generate instantly.
The user should also be able to fly around the area.
The terrain will use a custom shader to provide colour to it at different heights.

### Main Task Breakdown
-	Create a height map terrain generator using an algorithm or number of algorithms from the internet.
-	Create in game UI to change the generation settings
-	Create a first-person player that can move around the scene to view the map.
-	Create a height map layering system to combine multiple heightmaps into one, to allow for varied terrain types in the same map (flat ground, small hills, mountains)
-	Apply hydraulic erosion to some of the height map layers to create more natural looking mountains
### Technology
The fascinator will be using packages from Unityâ€™s DOTS stack (Data Oriented Tech Stack)
-	The Entity Component System (Preview Package [0.51.1-preview.21])
-	C# Jobs System (released)
-	The Burst Compiler (released)
I have experience using all of the above to improve performance of large simulations like terrain generation.
# Stretch goals
## Goal 1
I wish to create a glass building above the large area, where the player can be in, within this building are glass cabinets with scaled down and randomly generated terrain rotating in place and slowly transitioning between different randomly generated height maps.
The user can choose to select one of the cabinets, freezing the transitioning in the current state, and sending that state to the full-scale area. The user can then go and fly around to look closer at the map or modify it.
### Breakdown
-	Map transitioning (smoothly transitioning between height maps)
-	Full map instancing (the shader and material must only use data from the mesh to determine colour, no global data set from a script)
-	Increased optimisation to allow the random generation to be seamless
## Goal 2
Add map detailing
 (trees, bushes, flowers, grass)
### Breakdown
-	Height map generator must produce information about where to place map details depending on height and information from the erosion system.
## Goal 3
Create a water shader to allow lake formations to be created
### Breakdown
-	Modify the generator to randomly add lake areas
-	Create a mesh generator to display the lakes
-	Create an animated water shader for the lakes

## Tech
- Original Noise Generation alogrithims were written by Sebastian Lague and released under the MIT License https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Planets
- Original Hydraulic Erosion alogrithim was written by Sebastian Lague and released under the MIT License https://github.com/SebLague/Hydraulic-Erosion
- These algorithims are clearly stated and sourced in the code files they are relevant to in the latest commit.
- Conversion into the C# Jobs system for both of these projects was undertaken souly by myself as is the mesh generation Job.
- Terrain Shaders (Shader Graph) are based off the HLSL shaders in the Hydraulic Erosion repo by Sebastian Lague.
- These have been converted to shader graph by myself and then signficiantly modified to support multiple colours, colour blending, textures & texture blendingk, based off information provided in the mesh vertex colour channels and UV channels and through a supplimentary data texture.
